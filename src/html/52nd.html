        <h1>Stiletto</h1>
        <p>
            "Stiletto" is a song from Billy Joel's 1978 album 52nd Street. The song is a
            slow, melancholic ballad with a soaring chorus and a memorable guitar riff.
            The lyrics describe a romantic relationship that is struggling to survive,
            with the singer comparing his lover to a stiletto knife - something that is
            beautiful but also dangerous.
